# Contributing

Outside of raising issues, improving docs and bug fixes, I probably wouldn't advise contributing. However, if you do, here's how you can do it.

### Lint
Run the linter before any making pull requests: `npm run lint`
### Tests
Run the tests before submitting any pull requests: `npm test`
